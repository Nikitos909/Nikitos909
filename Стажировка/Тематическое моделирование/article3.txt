Paris Saint-Germain have reportedly offered ˆ40m for Milan full-back Theo Hernandez, but the Rossoneri immediately rejected the bid.

The French full-back arrived at San Siro from Real Madrid in 2019-20 and has excelled under Stefano Pioli.

The impressive performances in Serie A have not secured him a place next to his brother, Lucas, in the national team, but the French are not overlooking the 23-year-old completely.

Ligue 1 giants PSG are reportedly interested in the former Atletico Madrid youth, who has appeared 81 times for Milan, contributing 15 goals and 13 assists in the process.

Tuttosport reports the French side are looking to reinforce at left-back and have put ˆ40m on the plate for Hernandez.

Milan, who signed him from Real Madrid for a reported ˆ21.5m in the summer of 2019, are not interested in listening to offers for the influential left-back and have promptly rejected the approach from the French capital.

Hernandez has a contract with the Diavolo until June 2024.
